# REPORTING ERRORS/PROBLEMS

1. Please, if you report issues can you please attach (on pastebin or similar) your CLIENT rpt log file as this helps find out the errors very quickly. To find this logfile:

	```sqf
	C:\users\<YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Arma 2 OA\ArmA2OA.RPT
	```

**[>> Download <<](https://github.com/oiad/TakeClothes/archive/master.zip)**
	
# Installation Steps:

1) In your \dayzinstallfolder\MPMissions\dayz_1.Chernarus folder, create a subfolder called "scripts" or use another name if a folder with other add-on scripts exists.

2) Place the file that you've downloaded below into the "scripts" folder

3) If you don't already have your own fn_selfActions.sqf, compiles.sqf and variables.sqf you will need to extract them from the dayz_code.pbo file from 1.0.6 Epoch. My folder structure inside my mission directory looks like this:

	dayz_code\compile\fn_selfActions.sqf
	dayz_code\init\compiles.sqf
	dayz_code\init\variables.sqf

4) Edit your compiles.sqf and find the following code:

	fnc_usec_selfActions = compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\compile\fn_selfActions.sqf";		//Checks which actions for self

Replace it with this line:

	fnc_usec_selfactions = compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "dayz_code\compile\fn_selfActions.sqf";

5) If you already have a variables.sqf or you have copied over the default epoch one:

Find this line in variables.sqf:

	s_player_manageDoor = -1;
	
Add this after it:

	s_player_clothes = -1; // Zabns take clothes
	
6) Find these lines in fn_selfActions.sqf (around line 1160):

	player removeAction s_player_fuelauto;
	s_player_fuelauto = -1;
	player removeAction s_player_fuelauto2;
	s_player_fuelauto2 = -1;
	player removeAction s_player_manageDoor;
	s_player_manageDoor = -1;

Add these lines after it:

	// Take Clothes by Zabn
	player removeAction s_player_clothes;
	s_player_clothes = -1;

7) Find these lines in fn_selfActions.sqf (around line 926):

	} else {
		player removeAction s_player_fillgen;
		s_player_fillgen = -1;
	};
	
Add these lines after it:

	_clothesTaken = _cursorTarget getVariable["clothesTaken",false];
	_isZombie = _cursorTarget isKindOf "zZombie_base"; // Add this here now since epoch 1.0.6 doesn't initialize this where this will go.

	// Take clothes by Zabn
	if (_isMan and !_isAlive and !_isZombie and !_clothesTaken) then {
		if (s_player_clothes < 0) then {
			s_player_clothes = player addAction [format["<t color='#0096ff'>Take Clothes</t>"], "scripts\takeClothes.sqf",_cursorTarget,0, false,true];
		};
	} else {
		player removeAction s_player_clothes;
		s_player_clothes = -1;
	};
		
8) OPTIONAL: to remove certain skins from being removable, add this:

	case "EXAMPLE_SKIN": {
		_itemNew = "disabled";
	};

(obviously replace the EXAMPLE_SKIN with the classname of the skin)

under this:

	case "Bandit1_DZ": {
		_itemNew = "Survivor2_DZ";
	};

9) You're done! enjoy the new script! :)
